### Mobile Inbox

Apps using version 3.2.0 and later of this SDK can allow users to save in-app
messages to an inbox. This inbox displays a list of saved in-app messages and
allows users to read them at their convenience. The SDK provides a default user
interface for the inbox, which can be customized to match your brand's styles.
